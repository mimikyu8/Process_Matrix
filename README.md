# Process_Matrix
First assignment I made for the KeepCoding-Glovo Women in Tech Bootcamp

## Description

This function gets passed a list of lists (a matrix) and returns another matrix with the same shape and size, where each value is the average of the old value and its neighbors. This is also known as box blur and can be applied to pictures converted to matrices on python. It is coded to accept lists of lists, and hasn't been adapted for numpy arrays. 

## How to run

Download the file and save it in the same folder as your project. 
Import process_matrix to your file like
<pre><code>from process_matrix import process_matrix 
</code></pre>
